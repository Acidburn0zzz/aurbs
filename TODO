- build failure gracefully
	- use check_call for subprocesses
	- block build on missing dependencies or build-fail
		- hold builds, depending on that
- add status page (/var/cache/aurbs/status.json)
- add log collecting on failure (--> /var/lib/aurbs/fails/<arch>/<pkgname>/)
	- srcpkg, all logfiles
	- delete this directory on next successfull build
